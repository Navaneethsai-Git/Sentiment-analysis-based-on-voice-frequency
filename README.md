This project focuses on emotion recognition from speech using the TESS Toronto emotional speech dataset. Leveraging the power of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), the code performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis, visualizing audio features for emotions like fear, anger, happiness, and more. The dataset, consisting of 2,800 speech samples, undergoes feature extraction, specifically MFCCs, which are crucial in capturing the unique acoustic characteristics associated with different emotions.
